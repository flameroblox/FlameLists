Want to implement the FlameBlacklist System?

```lua
--[[FlameBlacklistLoaderScript]]

local blacklist.enabled = true -- set to false to bypass.

if local blacklist.enabled = true then
local barred = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flameroblox/SmartBot/main/Backend/barred.lua"))()
firstoperation()
wait(5)
error("FlameUniversalBlacklist has successfully been ran. Kicked the user running the script if they were blacklisted.")
end

Insert above script in the top of your very code for it to work and just let magic do its work.
